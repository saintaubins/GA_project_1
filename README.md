# GA_project_1

Everything works fine, I have no major issues, The application renders in the browser and runs with without any errors, on every page! Please note, I have 5 pages, as of this writing. The poject is deployed to GitHub Pages, and not a custom domain. I had some styling input from, family members to help me with UI, and UX. The only thing that I would add, is more levels, and make each proceeding level faster, or more difficult. I have 3 levels, as of this writing. One only other thing I regret is, I didn't use classes, and create instances of the classes or class, as an incorporation of my design. I will try next time, if it is applicable.

I can lay out instructions of the web pages here, this is also in my instructions page, of the website. they are as follows,... for my Simon, Memory Game:

My project is uploaded to the following page:

https://saintaubins.github.io/saintaubins.github.io-GA_project_1/

1.Go to level 1 in the navigation bar and press "Start".

(Yes I have a navigation bar, and I self learned bootStrap as a bonus during the project.)
                            
2.Look at the sequence of lights that illuminate in the squares.

(This took some time learing the setTimeout function but it worked)
                           
3.Try to follow the pattern.

(This is intuitive, just try to follow the light patterns.)
                           
4.If you need to see the pattern again, click "Start".

(This incorporates clicking the start button again, to see the same pattern again, not a new pattern unless another button is clicked, like reset, will start a new random pattern.)                            
5.If you win your "wins" go up, if you loose your "losses" go up.

(there are 2 counters that track wins and losses, stored to memory, but they get erased if you click on reset, or go to another level or page.)
                            
6.To play again, click on the "Play Again" Button.

(This only describes the play again button function, it allows you to play again, and keep a running track of wins, and losses)
                            
7.To reset the game click on "Reset".

(This allows you to reset the game, and clear wins and losses.)
                            
8.To go to the "Next Level" click on the "Next Level" Button.

(This allows you to go to the next level.)
                           
9.To play level 1 right now click on the "Play Now" Button.

(the Play now button allows you to go to the first level of the game.)

Any other questions, please advise!  
        
        thing works fine, I had styling input from, family members. the only thing I would add is more levels, and make each level faster.
